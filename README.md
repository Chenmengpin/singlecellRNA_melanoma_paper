# scRNA melanoma paper

Scripts related to the current version of our manuscript entitled _"**Robust gene expression programs underlie recurrent cell states and phenotype switching in melanoma**"_ published in [**Nature Cell Biology**](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-020-0547-3), previously available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/715995v2).

All scRNA-seq data, including SCENIC analyses, are available online as .loom files on our single-cell analysis platform [SCope](http://scope.aertslab.org/#/Wouters_Human_Melanoma).

The scRNA-seq gene expression data is also available on the [UCSC Cell Browser](https://melanoma.cells.ucsc.edu).

A track hub for the UCSC Genome Browser with bigwig and BED files of our ATAC-seq data (in hg19 and hg38) is available [here](http://ucsctracks.aertslab.org/papers/wouters_human_melanoma/hub.txt).

The single-cell and bulk RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data have also been deposited in GEO under the accession number [GSE134432](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE134432).

Raw images, tracking information and videos for the single-cell migration experiments, and raw data, images and videos for the bulk migration experiments, are made available on the [Open Science Framework of the Center for Open Science](https://osf.io/e6ahm/).

All gene regulatory networks (GRN) in the manuscript are made available on the Network Data Exchange NDEx: the [global melanoma GRN](https://doi.org/10.18119/N99C71), the [intermediate GRN](http://doi.org/10.18119/N95P54) and a [highly refined SOX10 regulon]( http://doi.org/10.18119/N91W2T).
