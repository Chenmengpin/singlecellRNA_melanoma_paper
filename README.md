# scRNA melanoma paper

Scripts related to the current version of our manuscript entitled _"Single-cell gene regulatory network analysis reveals new melanoma cell states and transition trajectories during phenotype switching"_ (Wouters, Kalender-Atak et al.), available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/715995v2).

All scRNA-seq data, including SCENIC analyses, are available online as .loom files on our single-cell analysis platform [SCope](http://scope.aertslab.org/#/Wouters_Human_Melanoma).

The scRNA-seq gene expression data is also available on the [UCSC Cell Browser](https://melanoma.cells.ucsc.edu).

A track hub for the UCSC Genome Browser with bigwig and BED files of our ATAC-seq data (in hg19 and hg38) is available [here](http://ucsctracks.aertslab.org/papers/wouters_human_melanoma/hub.txt).

The scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq data have also been deposited in GEO under the accession number [GSE134432](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE134432).

Raw images, tracking information and videos for the single-cell migration experiments, and raw data, images and videos for the bulk migration experiments, are made available on the [Open Science Framework of the Center for Open Science](https://osf.io/e6ahm/).

All gene regulatory networks (GRN) in the manuscript are made available on the Network Data Exchange NDEx: the [global melanoma GRN](http://ndexbio.org/#/network/13324594-54a5-11ea-bfdc-0ac135e8bacf?accesskey=719bdfb839a493d6f2210a262f5ab8075fcbcb8ce278d17c33a3835bee6e535c), the [intermediate GRN](http://ndexbio.org/#/network/e794d684-5496-11ea-bfdc-0ac135e8bacf?accesskey=8a86845e9a2fcc560441ee2919ca36127a841301e82ab25cfab4aae76d9fcf49) and a [highly refined SOX10 regulon](http://ndexbio.org/#/network/eb54f657-5497-11ea-bfdc-0ac135e8bacf?accesskey=c4120b6074ef20f2622724d36ebf7e69723039cc830677d7b23940576b46d00c).
